<H1>IO&nbsp;- I/O Support Library</H1>

The IO library contains abstraction classes for file I/O. It is used extensively throughout the higher-level libraries.

<H2>Header Files</H2>

<DL>
<DT>File.h</DT>
<DD>File is an abstract base class to support high-performance endianness-safe binary read/write access to data sources and sinks of various types.</DD>

<DT>SeekableFile.h</DT>
<DD>SeekableFile is a base class derived from IO::File to indicate files whose read and write positions can be changed via seek... methods.</DD>

<DT>StandardFile.h</DT>
<DD>StandardFile is a concrete class to support high-performance access to standard files.</DD>

<DT>GzippedFile.h</DT>
<DD>GzippedFile is a concrete class for read access to gzip-compressed files.</DD>

<DT>MemMappedFile.h</DT>
<DD>MemMappedFile is a concrete class for read/write access to memory-mapped files, mostly to simplify resource management.</DD>

<DT>FixedMemoryFile.h</DT>
<DD>FixedMemoryFile is a concrete class to support high-performance reading from temporary files represented as fixed-size in-memory buffers.</DD>

<DT>VariableMemoryFile.h</DT>
<DD>VariableMemoryFile is a concrete class to support high-performance writing to temporary files represented as linked lists of in-memory buffers.</DD>

<DT>OpenFile.h</DT>
<DD>OpenFile.h contains namespace-global functions to open files using appropriate concrete implementations of the IO::File abstraction.</DD>

<DT>ZipArchive.h</DT>
<DD>ZipArchive is a class representing ZIP archive files, using a IO::SeekableFile abstraction to represent the ZIP archive, and granting read access to files stored in a ZIP archive using IO::File abstractions.</DD>

<DT>XBaseTable.h</DT>
<DD>XBaseTable is a class to read from database tables in XBase (dBASE III, dBASE IV, FoxPro, Clipper,...) format. It currently only supports basic dBASE III data types, and no memo fields.</DD>

<DT>TokenSource.h</DT>
<DD>TokenSource is a class to split the character stream from an object derived from IO::File into a stream of tokens, with flexible definitions of syntactic character classes.</DD>

<DT>ValueSource.h</DT>
<DD>ValueSource is a class to split the character stream from an object derived from IO::File into a stream of strings or numbers, with flexible definitions of syntactic character classes.</DD>

<DT>CSVSource.h</DT>
<DD>CSVSource is a class implementing a comma-separated value file structure over objects derived from IO::File.</DD>
